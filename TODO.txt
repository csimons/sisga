- Implement De Jong F4, F5 functions.
- Implement Ackley function.

- Create program for aggregate analysis, including calculation of:
  - Standard deviation of AES.
  - Standard deviation of MBF.
  - Percent deviation from optimality (where known).

- Develop metrics for analysis where optimum is unknown.
  - Some percentage of deviation from MBF considered good enough?
