- Implement De Jong F4, F5 functions.
- Implement Ackley function.

- Create program for aggregate analysis, including calculation of:
  - Success rate ("SR") (where known).
  - Average number of evaluations to a solution ("AES").
  - Mean best fitness ("MBR").
  - Standard deviation of AES.
  - Standard deviation of MBR.
  - Percent deviation from optimality (where known).

- Develop metrics for analysis where optimum is unknown.
  - Some percentage of deviation from MBR considered good enough?
